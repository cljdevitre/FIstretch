# RelaxiFI
RelaxiFI is an open-source python3 package designed to model the stretching of CO2-dominated fluid inclusions by stress-relaxation dislocation creep, it is based on the model and parameters described by Wanamaker and Evans (1989). Currently, RelaxiFI is not equipped to model stretching in minerals other than olivine, sorry!
