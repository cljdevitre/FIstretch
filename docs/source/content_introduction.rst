Welcome to RelaxiFI - An Open-Source python3 tool for modelling stretching of CO2-dominated fluid inclusions during olivine stress relaxation

RelaxiFI is the right tool for you if you:

* study CO2-dominated fluid inclusions and use them for barometry in water-poor volcanic systems
* study said FI in olivine hosts (RelaxiFI does not currently support other minerals, sorry!)
* want to model the stretching of said FI during ascent
* want to model the stretching of said FI during stalling 
* want to model the stretching of said FI during quenching

This tool is currently in progress, with planned submission in the near future.

We welcome user feedback/requests for new functions to be included. You can either email the lead author (cl.devitre@gmail.com), or post an enhancement request/report of a bug on the Issue page of the github page. https://github.com/cljdevitre/RelaxiFI/issues

If you have used RelaxiFI in your work,  please check back to see if there is a doi for you to cite.
