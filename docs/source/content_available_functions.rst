Calculating entrapment depth, FI pressure and CO2 density
======================
RelaxiFI includes functions originally on DiadFit v.0.71 (https://github.com/PennyWieser/DiadFit),
to aid in calculating internal pressure and density of CO2 with Equations of State as well as depths of entrapment.

Modelling polybaric stretching
======================

RelaxiFI allows users to model stretching of CO2 dominated FI during ascent and decompression. 
An option is included to reduce the data output so that it can be fed into a subsequent model step. 


Modelling isobaric stretching
====================

RelaxiFI users to evaluate stretching of FI during storage or quenching, with a constant external pressure. 
There is also a function to loop through different FI sizes and distances from crystal defects at constant external pressure.
